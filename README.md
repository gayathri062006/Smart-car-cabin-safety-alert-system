# Smart-car-cabin-safety-alert-system
This project simulates a smart car cabin safety system using Arduino, PIR sensor and a temperature sensor (DS18B20/DHT11) on Wokwi. When a person is detected inside the car and the cabin temperature crosses warning/danger levels, the system gives visual (LED) and audio (buzzer) alerts.
